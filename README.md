# Track Phone Number Location Using Python

## Overview

The **Track Phone Number Location Using Python** project allows users to track the geographic location of a phone number using various Python libraries. By parsing the phone number, this application determines its location and visualizes it on a map.

## Features

- **Phone Number Parsing:** Utilizes the `phonenumbers` library to validate and parse phone numbers.
- **Geolocation:** Employs the `geocoder` library to fetch location details based on the phone number.
- **Mapping:** Uses the `folium` library to create interactive maps that display the tracked location.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input prompts for users to enter phone numbers.

## Libraries Used

- **phonenumbers:** For parsing and validating phone numbers.
- **geocoder:** To retrieve geographical information based on phone numbers.
- **folium:** To create and visualize maps with the tracked location.
- **Other Libraries:** Any additional libraries used for data handling or visualization (e.g., `requests`).
